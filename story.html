      <div id="story">
        According to greek mythology, In a land far away named Crete, There was
        a monster named Minotaur structured half bull and half man wielding two
        axes like a battle god terrorizing people. Minos the king of Crete tried
        everything within his power to restrain the monster. He tried keeping it
        in the hardest prison it could be in but nothing kept the monster at
        bay. Then finally the king prayed to Poseidon, the god of the sea then
        the god sent the legendary artificer Daedalus. He built a maze which was
        named as labyrinth. It was built at city Konssas. The Minotaur was lured
        into the labyrinth and it is not able to escape from the labyrinth from
        then on.
